Use templates for quick setup of projects.

Examples:

- [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org)
- [ml-skeleton-py](https://github.com/datarootsio/ml-skeleton-py)
  - Makefile
  - docker-compose.yml
- [ai-ml-project-template](https://github.com/ZenithClown/ai-ml-project-template)
  - logs
  - Boilerplate notebooks
- create your own template

1. **Microsoft Learn**: Start with the official Microsoft Learn platform. It's free and comprehensive. For each certification:
   1. Visit the certification page
   2. Go through all Microsoft Learn modules
   3. Complete hands-on exercises

2. **John Savill's YouTube Channel**: An absolute goldmine of Azure knowledge! John, a Microsoft employee, offers:
   1. Detailed study playlists for each certification
   2. Weekly Azure updates
   3. 4-hour study cram videos before exams

I recommend watching John's videos alongside the Microsoft Learn content to reinforce your understanding.

3. **Practice Exams**: Microsoft now offers free practice assessments. Use these to gauge your readiness and identify weak areas.
