		<p>This species is rarely mentioned in older books on fungal identification because it is a relative new-comer to Great Britain; the first record, near Pickering, was in 1969. It is now very common, however, especially in conifer plantations where it frequently takes the place of Yellow Fingers from which it differs in having a larger, stalked, more flattened, club-shaped fruitbody.</p>
