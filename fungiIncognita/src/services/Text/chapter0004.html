		<p>Mushrooms and toadstools belong to the fungal kingdom. There are about 4,000 species of larger fungi in Britain. Of the larger umbrella-shaped fungi with a cap and stem, mushroom is a popular term for those that are edible; toadstool for those that are poisonous.</p>
		<br />
		<p>A fungus is not a plant. Most plants make food using the sunâ€™s energy. Animals and fungi need a food source, usually plant or animal, living or dead. Animals digest food internally. In fungi enzymes dissolve the food externally from where it is absorbed.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Plants and animals are made up of many tiny cells, but mushrooms and toadstools are composed of very thin tubes known as hyphae. As a hypha grows it branches and produces a web of threads known as a mycelium. This is the equivalent of stems, roots and leaves in a plant. On a flat surface it often grows as an expanding disc and this shape is clearly seen in simple fungi such as moulds on food.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Unlike moulds, mushrooms and toadstools reproduce by forming spores in large fruitbodies. These are the structures that are described in this book and frequently the rest of the fungus is hidden from view. A fruitbody may only exist for a few days before rotting away but the mycelium which produces it may live for years and some individuals are known to be hundreds of years old.</p>
