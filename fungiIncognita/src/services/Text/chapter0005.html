		<p>Many species described in this book are found among short mown or grazed grass. Such fungi feed on dead plant or animal material present in the soil. Undisturbed pasture that has not been ploughed or had chemical fertilisers applied is usually much richer in fungi than reseeded grass which has been limed and fertilised.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Lawns and playing fields are often carefully prepared, with the soil being riddled to remove stones and as such provide perfect sites for the growth of ‘fairy rings’ - the appearance of a ring of fruitbodies. In the past these were explained away by references to toads or fairies but they result from fruitbodies being produced at the growing edge of the buried mycelium which under uniform soil conditions grows as a circular disc. As the mycelium grows so the size of the circle increases.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Grazed grassland attracts species of fungi that feed on dung. Horse and cow dung is especially rich in fungi though many have small fruitbodies. Larger species include Dung Roundhead and Egg-shell Toadstool.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Woodlands are home to a wide range of fungi. In addition to species growing in woodland soil there are those that rot tree leaves (including conifer needles), those that rot fallen wood and old stumps and those that feed on living trees. Of the latter some enter as germinating spores through a wound and the mycelium spreads before producing bracket-like fruitbodies from the trunk. Others invade via the tree roots and form a web or mycorrhiza (fungus root). Such fungi draw food from tree roots but produce terrestrial fruitbodies though some (e.g. truffles) produce them underground.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Many fungi are restricted to one or a small number of tree species. Jelly Antler Fungus grows on pine stumps and also on spruce. Hen of the Woods is only found at the base of oak trees. Mycorrhizal species are especially host specific and their names often relate to this, e.g. Brown Birch Bolete and Beechwood Sickener. Some tree species have a large number of associated species of fungi and among those with the most are oak, beech, birch and Scots pine.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Other habitats include gardens and parks. More specific places include cellars, wood stacks, old bonfire sites and manure heaps. Some fungi, e.g. Ergot, grow from grass flowers while others emerge from the bodies of animals they have killed.</p>

		<p class="style0">Edible and Poisonous Fungi</p>
		<p>Many edible fungi have ‘lookalikes’ which may be poisonous. This is even true for the Field Mushroom, the most commonly consumed wild fungus in Britain. Beginners must on no account gather wild fungi to eat unless they have been correctly identified by an expert. Before eating wild fungi consult How to Identify Edible Mushrooms by Harding, Lyon and Tomblin, published by HarperCollins.</p>
