		<p>Medium-sized, it is rich red-brown when young but paler with age. The depressed centre remains darker. The crowded gills are only shortly decurrent and mature from cream to pinky-buff. The slender stem is a similar colour to the cap near its base but much paler at its apex. Damaged gills release lots of white milk which does not dry yellow (test on a handkerchief).</p>
		<br />
