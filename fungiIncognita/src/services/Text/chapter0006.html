		<p>Some fungi cannot be identified without a microscope but most of the species in this book can be named using macro characters. Collect the whole fungus (using a knife if necessary) and place in a basket. Fragile species are best put in small boxes. Make notes about habitat, e.g. ‘growing on a stump’ or ‘under birch’ and remember that a slimy texture or faint smell may dry or fade.</p>
		<br />
		<p>In this book descriptions concentrate on characters of the fruitbody, including colour (which is very variable), shape (which often changes as the fruitbody matures - nb a raised central region is known as an umbo), smell and texture. Most species are umbrella- or mushroom-shaped and have gills on the cap underside, like shop mushrooms.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Gill characters are important, especially the way they are attached to the stem. This is best seen by slicing the cap in half.</p>

		<p>A spore print (the colour of a mass of spores) is very important for accurate identification. Remove stem and put the cap gills (or tubes) down on a piece of glass. Cover to keep moist and leave for at least 4 hours, after which there be a white or coloured deposit.</p>

		<p class="style0">Species entries</p>
		<p>The information provided is arranged as follows:</p>
		<p>• A symbol – see Introduction for explanation</p>
		<p>• The Family or group to which the species belongs.</p>
		<p>• The Spore Colour of the species.</p>
		<p>• The English Name of the species. In some cases where there is more than one English name in common usage an alternative is mentioned.</p>
		<p>• The Latin Name of the species. As with flowering plants this binomial is printed in italics. The first part of the name is the genus to which it belongs. The second part is the species name. As with other organisms Latin names can change, especially as modern research improves our knowledge of the relationship between species. Where there have been recent changes the former Latin name is also given.</p>
		<br />
		<p>• The main paragraph gives background details and lists the most important features to aid identification. Features are described in order: cap, gills (where present) and stem. Features that cannot be shown in the photograph such as texture and smell are also listed here.</p>
		<br />
		<p class="style0">SIZE This gives the normal range. The measures are (usually) for cap diameter, stem height and stem width.</p>
		<p class="style0">HABITAT An important section as some fungi are only found in very restricted habitats.</p>
		<p class="style0">SEASON This gives the usual fruiting season but remember that unusual weather conditions may cause fruitbodies to appear at odd times.</p>
		<p class="style0">POISONOUS Edible, Inedible, Poisonous (red = Very poisonous) An indication of possible culinary use is given but beginners should avoid gathering and eating wild fungi without an expert having identified them first.</p>
		<p class="style0">SIMILAR SPECIES This section includes both closely related species (usually in the same genus) and species which look similar and may confuse a beginner.</p>
