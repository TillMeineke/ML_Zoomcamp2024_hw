🎉 Just wrapped up Week 4 of Machine Learning for Classification! 🚀

This week we delved into the fascinating world of Evaluation Metrics for Classification.

Here's our ML feast for the week:

🔮 Churn prediction project

🤖 Accuracy and dummy model

🔢 Confusion table

⚖️ Precision and Recall

📈 ROC Curves

🏆 ROC AUC

🔄 Cross-Validation

It was an insightful dive into the different ways we can measure our models' performance in classification tasks, helping us become better at understanding and improving our models! Looking forward to Week 5! 👀
