Over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds

## About Dataset

### Context

This dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in colour and age.

### Content

- Number of categories: 120
- Number of images: 20,580
- Annotations: Class labels, Bounding boxes

## Inspiration

- Can you correctly identify dog breeds that have similar features, such as the basset hound and bloodhound?
- Is this chihuahua young or old?
