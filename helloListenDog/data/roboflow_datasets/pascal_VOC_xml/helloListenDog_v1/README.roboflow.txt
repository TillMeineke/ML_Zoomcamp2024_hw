The dataset includes 2715 images.
Dog are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 25 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
