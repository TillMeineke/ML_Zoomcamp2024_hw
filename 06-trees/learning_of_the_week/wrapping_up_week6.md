🌳 Wrapping Up the Week in Tree-Based Models!

In this lesson, we reviewed everything we covered on tree-based models and ensemble learning. Here’s the scoop:

🌲 Decision Trees

- Simple yet powerful, decision trees split data into decision nodes and leaves. But, watch out! Without depth limits, they overfit and memorize training data rather than generalizing.
- Key parameter: max depth — limiting it can improve validation performance!

🌲🌲 Random Forests

- An ensemble of decision trees trained in parallel, random forests combine multiple “experts” for stronger predictions.
- We experimented with parameters like max depth and min samples leaf to find the sweet spot for model performance.

🌲🌲🌲 Boosting with XGBoost

- Unlike random forests, XGBoost trains trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the mistakes of the previous ones. We tuned parameters like the learning rate to control model steps and improve precision.
- Result? XGBoost led the pack as the top performer on tabular data!

✨ Pro Tip: XGBoost can even handle missing values, making it incredibly versatile!

Next 3 weeks, we’ll be tackling our midterm project. Exciting times ahead!

You can still suggest a project idea or hint me at an interesting dataset. I’m all ears! 🌟
