🌳 Random Forests: Practical Insights from ML Zoomcamp

Just completed ML Zoomcamp session on Random Forests. Here’s what I learned:

Key Takeaways:

📊 Random Forests combine multiple decision trees for predictions
🔍 Each tree uses random feature subsets for diversity
📈 Testing showed performance plateaus around 50 trees
⚙️ Key parameters explored:
• max_depth: 10 showed good results
• min_samples_leaf: 3 balanced complexity/performance
• n_jobs=-1: Utilized parallel processing
💡 Important: Set random_state for reproducible results

Ready to apply these ensemble methods to real-world problems! Who else is excited about Random Forests? 🙋‍♂️
