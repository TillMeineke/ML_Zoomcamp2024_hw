🎯 Decision Tree Parameter Tuning

Just completed a deep dive into parameter tuning for decision trees! Here’s what we covered:

Key Parameters

🕳️ Max Depth

- Controls tree layers and complexity
- Optimal values found between 4-6 layers
- Prevents overfitting when properly tuned

📊 Min Samples Leaf

- Controls minimum group size at leaf nodes
- Values tested: 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, 200, 500
- Helps balance model complexity and performance
Tuning Process

🔍 Parameter Search Strategy

- First tune max_depth parameter
- Then optimize min_samples_leaf
- Used validation set for performance evaluation
- Measured success using AUC score

📈 Best Results

- Max depth of 6 with min_samples_leaf of 15 achieved optimal performance
- Alternative good configuration: max_depth=10, min_samples_leaf=15
- Balanced between model complexity and accuracy

Visualization

🗺️ Heat Map Analysis

- Created pivot table of results
- Visualized using seaborn heatmap
- Lighter colors indicated better performance
- Helped identify optimal parameter combinations
