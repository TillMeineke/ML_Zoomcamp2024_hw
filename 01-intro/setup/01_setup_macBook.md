# Setup MacBook with Apple Silicon (arm64) for data science

I use a MacBook Pro 13" with Apple Silicon (arm64) and VSCode as my main editor. I use Conda as my environment manager and created a dedicated environment for the course. I also installed some additional software that I find useful.

## Install Homebrew

First install [üç∫ Homebrew](https://brew.sh "üç∫ Homebrew") as a package manager for macOS, in `Terminal.app` run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install software

  - `tableau-public`: for data visualization
  - `keycastr`: for showing key presses
  - `rectangle`: for window management
  - `libreoffice` and `libreoffice-language-pack`: a free office suite
  - `slack` and `telegram`: for communication
