🎉 Good news, everyone! I’ve just completed Module 1 of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) with DataTalksClub founded by [Alexey Grigorev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agrigorev/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BEthTJHX3SFWvJ47kfAy%2BFA%3D%3D)! 🚀
