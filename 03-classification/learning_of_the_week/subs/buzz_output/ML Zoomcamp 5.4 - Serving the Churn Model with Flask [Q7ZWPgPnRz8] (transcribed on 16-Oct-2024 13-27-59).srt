28
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,460
Previously

29
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,119
we

30
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:08,740
created

31
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:08,940

37
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,520
for

38
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:10,920

39
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,120
a

41
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,460

42
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,680

48
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,140
and

49
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,320
we

50
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:13,680
also

51
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:13,880

52
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,680
already

53
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:14,900
talked

54
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,240
about

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,600
Flask

56
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:15,700
and

57
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,300
creating

58
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,480
a

Flask.

64
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,120
So

65
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,160
in

66
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,400
this

67
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,680

68
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,780
we

69
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,040
will

70
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,140
put

71
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,460

72
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,860
together

73
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,240
and

74
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,480
we

75
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,780
will

76
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,320
take

77
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,880

80
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:22,720
that

81
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:22,980
we

82
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,160
have

83
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:23,780
and

84
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,040
turn

85
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,220
it

86
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:24,600
into

87
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,900

90
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,180
So

91
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,460
let's

92
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,620
start.

93
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,100
What

94
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,220
we

95
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,380
want

96
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,460
to

97
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,680
do

98
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,100
is

99
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,220
we

100
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,440
want

101
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,580
to

102
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:28,860
create

103
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,300

service,

106
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,060
let's

107
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,540
call

108
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:31,860
it

109
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:31,860

service.

111
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,280
So

112
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,440
this

113
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,880

114
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,420

117
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,200
right,

118
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,660
and

119
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:37,920
we

120
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,300
want

121
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,640
this

122
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:38,900

123
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,000
to

124
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,240
be

125
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,740

128
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,860

root,

130
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:42,620
and

131
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,060
then

132
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,340
let's

133
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:43,800
say

134
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:43,880
we

135
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,100
have

136
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,600

here,

140
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,500
so

141
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:47,820
they

142
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,080
will

143
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,380
send

144
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,600

145
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:48,800
some

147
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,580
about

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,220
customers,

149
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,040
so

150
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,240
it

151
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,500
will

152
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,020
look

153
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,600
exactly

154
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,340
like

155
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,560
that.

156
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,560
All

157
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,000
the

159
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,120
we

160
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,160
know

161
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,420

164
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,620
and

165
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:57,880
then

166
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,220
we

167
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,440
will

168
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,080
reply

169
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,500
them

170
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,200
with

171
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,320
basically

172
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,640
this

173
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,280
probability

174
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,760
of

churning.

176
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:03,980
This

177
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,099
is

178
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:04,220
what

179
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,360
we

180
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,459
want

181
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:04,560
to

182
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,739
do.

183
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:04,959
We

184
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,080
want

185
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,239
to

186
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,420
create

187
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,800
a

188
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:05,800

189
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,220
method

190
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,660
and

191
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:06,980
then

192
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,400
put

193
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,520
it

194
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,120
to

195
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,600
the

address.

199
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,260
So

200
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,440
let's

201
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,780
do

202
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:10,980
that.

203
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:12,760
So

204
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,980
we

205
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,240
have

206
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,600
this

207
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,140

208
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,240
we'll

209
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,740
call

210
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,120
predict.

211
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,040
So

212
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,340
this

213
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,780
function

214
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,140
meets

215
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,420
a

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,040
customer,

217
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:19,740
and

218
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:19,920
then

219
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,280
we

220
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,580
simply

221
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,060
return

222
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,060
the

223
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,800
predictions.

224
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,080
So

225
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:23,760
this

226
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:23,940
is

227
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,060
what

228
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,300
we

229
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,560
want

230
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,040
to

231
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,400
now

232
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,860
turn

233
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,240
into

234
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,280
a

235
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,440

236
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,760
service.

237
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,780
So

238
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:27,960
let

239
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,140
me

240
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,420
remove

241
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,620
the

242
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,000

243
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,280

244
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,520
a

245
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,640
while.

246
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:29,960
We'll

247
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,140
just

248
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,400
create

249
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,880
a

250
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,320
different

251
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,620
file.

252
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:31,980
So

253
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,060
what

254
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,240
we

255
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,440
need

256
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,820
here

257
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,340
now

258
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,340
is,

259
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,260
let

260
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,300
me

261
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,460
remove

262
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,800
that.

263
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,940
So

264
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,240
let

265
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,520
me

266
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,780
open

267
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,320
this

268
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,260
other

269
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,060

270
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,400
with

271
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,740
our

272
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:40,900

273
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,240
service

274
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,780
and

275
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,220
just

276
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,320
copy

277
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,800
everything.

278
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,580
I'll

279
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:43,840
put

280
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:43,980
it

281
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,360
here.

282
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,180
So

283
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,680
let's

284
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,260
add

285
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,040
Flask.

286
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,380
Let's

287
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,600
put

288
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,700

291
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:49,840
at

292
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,020

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,180
top,

294
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,740
and

295
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,420
then

296
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,520
we'll

297
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,960
create

298
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,060
a

299
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,360

300
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,680
app.

301
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:52,920
Let's

302
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,460
do

303
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,620
it

304
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,140
here.

305
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,340
We

306
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,800
can

307
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,140
call

308
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,620
the

309
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:56,940
app

310
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,900
churn,

311
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,620
and

312
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,840
we

313
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,040
want

314
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,220
to

315
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,540
put

316
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:00,840
it

317
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,180
to

318
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,900

319
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,080

320
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,720
predict,

321
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,420
and

322
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:03,660
instead

323
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:03,920
of

324
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,140
using

325
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,480
the

328
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,220
we'll

329
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,520
use

330
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,900

331
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,220
post.

332
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,420
So

333
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,600
the

334
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,039
reason

335
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,280

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,500
that

337
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,680
is

338
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:08,919
because

339
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,100
we

340
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,280
want

341
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,460

348
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,420
and

349
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:11,900
we

350
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,200
cannot

351
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,540

352
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,760
do

353
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:12,960

358
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:14,800
So

359
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,120
let

360
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,220

361
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,320

368
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,140
When

369
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,760
we

370
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,960
send

375
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,680

381
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,960
So

382
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,280
the

383
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,720

408
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,100
And

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,240
exactly

412
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,620

413
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,100

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,200
we

422
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,700
use

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:41,800
So

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:41,940
let

432
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,680
So

433
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,100
now

434
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,520
this

435
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,140
is

436
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,220
a

437
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,580
JSON

438
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,680

439
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,460
that

440
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,880
contains

441
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,080
some

442
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,360
fields.

443
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:49,740
So

444
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:49,920
for

445
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,100
each

446
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,300
field,

447
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,600
it

448
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,920
contains

449
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,400
values.

450
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:51,940
This

451
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,240
is

452
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,600
JSON.

453
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:52,920
And

454
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,340
this

455
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,460
is

456
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,560
what

457
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,720
we

458
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,840
want

459
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,040
to

460
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,200

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,620
our

465
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:55,960
And

466
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,580
unfortunately,

467
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,180
in

468
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,180
Flask,

469
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,460
it's

470
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,620

that.

475
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,440
So

476
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,440
here

477
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,660
we

that

483
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:01,920
we

484
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,040

and

488
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,080
we

489
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,260
want

490
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,380

491
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,740
extract

492
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,440
the

499
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,020
So

500
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,160
for

501
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,460

it

602
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,500

It

667
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:10,980
So

668
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,100
we

669
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,340

Let's

00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,120
make

681
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,340
this

682
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,800

683
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:16,700
Churn,

684
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,260

685
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,060
we'll

686
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,360

691
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:21,880
So

692
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,079
it

693
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,260
will

694
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,640

705
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,340
So

706
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,420
we

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,600

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,160

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,020

738
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:41,880
We

739
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,980
now

740
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,660
just

741
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,600
invoke

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:44,820

744
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,500

748
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,100
Yeah,

749
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,260
so

750
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,460
it's

751
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,720
a

763
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520
So

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,780
this

765
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,040

781
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,460

782
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,500

not.

792
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,560
We

I

816
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,060

824
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,800
So

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:10,980

860
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,440
So

861
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,500
let's

862
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,660
just

863
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:23,940
test

864
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,100
it.

865
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,460
I

866
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,720
think

867
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,220
here

868
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,420
we

869
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,600
will

870
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,840
now

871
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,040
have

872
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,480
an

873
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:26,840
error,

874
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,020
and

875
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,300
I

876
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,460
just

877
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,560
want

878
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,020
you

879
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,260
to

880
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,500
see

881
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,760
this

882
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,000
error

883
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,200
before

884
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,560
we

885
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,760
fix

886
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,860
it.

887
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,300
So

888
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,580
let's

889
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:30,800
run

890
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:30,900
it.

891
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,160
So

892
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,340
we

893
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,620
have

894
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:32,900
this

895
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,560
Python

896
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,140
predict.

897
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,420
So

898
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,060
it

899
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,260
run

900
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,580
our

901
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,200
application

902
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,660
and

903
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:38,860
it

904
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,060
is

905
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,480
available.

906
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,080
So

907
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,720
now

908
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,020
we

909
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,440
want

910
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,860
to

911
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,420
communicate

912
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,520

913
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,200

916
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,300
So

917
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,400
now

918
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,600
let's

919
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,040
pretend

920
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,440
we're

921
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,540

924
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,880
and

925
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,160
we

926
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,560
will

927
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280

932
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,100
So

933
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,380
let

934
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,520
me

935
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,680
just

936
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,040
create

940
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,240
I'll

941
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,700
call

942
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,800

947
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,200
So

948
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,680
from

949
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,960

we

952
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,000

remember

962
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,900

963
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,220

we

969
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:06,880
could

970
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,100
just

971
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,400
do

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,640

976
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,020
Here

977
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,220
it's

978
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,360

981
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,320
because

992
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,300
will

993

now

994
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,000
say

995
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,460

999
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,580
because

1000
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,020
a

1001
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,320

1007
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,020
So

1008
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,020
you

1009
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,220
can

1010
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,400

1015
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:21,760
So

1016
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:21,860
the

1017
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,460

1018
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:22,640
is

1019
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,800
trying

1025
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,660
But

1026
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,260
it

1027
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,980

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,820
meaning

1030
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,940
the

1031
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,380

1032
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,620

1042
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,040
So

1043
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,120
we

1044
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,260
need

1045
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,380

1050
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,440
And

1051
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,580
from

1052
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:32,760

it's

easy.

1057
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,640
So

1071
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:36,840
And

1072
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:36,980
for

1073
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,160
that,

1074
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,340
there

1075
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,460
is

1076
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,640
a

1077
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:37,740
great

1078
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,120
library

1079
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,480
called

1080
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:38,820
requests.

1081
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,620
So

1082
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:39,820
we'll

1083
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,120
use

1084
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,400
that.

1085
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,800
Let's

1086
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:40,960
say

1087
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,140
our

1088
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,900

1089
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,520
is

1090
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,000
http

1091
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,540

1093
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,000
predict.

1094
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,860
Let's

1095
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,100
take

1096
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,380
our

1097
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,040
customer.

1098
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Customer

1099
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,840
we

1100
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:49,980
want

1101
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,160
to

1102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,420
send.

1103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,020
I

1104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,080
think

1105
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,540
I

1106
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,740
saved

1107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:51,840
this

1108
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,460
customer

1109
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,800
here.

1110
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,000
So

1111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,820
this

1112
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:54,960
is

1113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,060
our

1114
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,760
customer.

1115
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,160
By

1116
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,320
the

1117
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,580
way,

1118
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,000
as

1119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,140
you

1120
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,660
see,

1121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,120
JSON

1122
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,800

1123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,080
turned

1124
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,180
out

1125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,580
to

1126
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:00,900
be

1127
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,000
a

1130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,040
dictionary.

1131
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,580
So

1132
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:02,680
we

1133
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,860
have

1134
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,300
this

1135
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:03,760
customer

1136
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,280
here.

1137
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,600
So

1138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:04,740
what

1139
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:04,860
we

1140
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,020
want

1141
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,120

1142
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,240
do

1143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,500
now

1144
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,700
is

1145
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:05,800
we

1146
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,000
want

1147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,640
to

1148
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,860
send

1149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,200
this

1150
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,800

1151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,140

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:08,880
request.

1155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,480
So

1156
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,680
for

1157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,900
that,

1158
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,160
we

1159
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,380
use

1160
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,540
requests.

1161
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,340
And

1162
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,540
then

1163
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:11,720
there

1164
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:11,840
is

1165
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,040
a

1166
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,400

1167
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,500

1168
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,060
posts.

1169
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,560
And

1170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,740
then

1171
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,880
it

1172
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,120
needs

1173
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,320
a

1175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,060
this

1176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,420
URL.

1177
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,960
And

1178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,540
we

1179
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,220
say

1180
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,380
that

1181
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,540
we

1182
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:17,720
want

1183
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:17,840
to

1184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,040
send

1185
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,300
this

1186
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,820

1187
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,360

JSON.

1189
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,280
Now

1190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,520
you

1191
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:21,740

500.

1196
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:23,740
So

1197
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,980
this

1198
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,180
is

1199
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,440

1201
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,060
So

1202
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,180
and

1203
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,540
remember,

1204
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,060
I

1205
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,280

1206
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,540
you

1207
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,720

1208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:26,940
there

1209
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,040
will

1210
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,280
be

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,460

1213
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:27,780
And

1214
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,120
I

1215
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,400
want

1216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,700

error.

1221
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:29,660
So

1222
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:29,720
it

1223
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:29,960

1237
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,620

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,560
to

1280
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,900
turn

1281
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,500
usual

1282
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,940
Python

1283
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,320
booleans

1284
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,440
into

1285
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:51,920
text.

1286
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,440
So

1287
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,660
we

1288
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,800
need

1289
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:52,980
to

1290
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,120
do

1291
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,520
now

1292
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,120
is

1293
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,520
wrap

1294
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,860
this

1295
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,140
churn

1296
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,240
into

1297
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,500
boolean.

1298
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,360
So

1299
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:57,720
this

1300
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:57,920
will

1301
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,380
turn

1302
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,020
the

1303
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,040
NumPy

1304
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,540
boolean

1305
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,240
into

1306
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,600
a

1307
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,840
usual

1308
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,080
Python

1309
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,500
boolean.

1310
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,700
And

1311
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,040
this

1312
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,180
ypret

1313
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,240
is

1314
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,800
also,

1315
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,240
I

1316
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,380
think,

1317
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,620
from

1318
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:04,840
NumPy.

1319
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,520
So

1320
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,780
this

1321
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,300
is

1322
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,300
a

1323
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,460
float

1324
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,560
64,

1325
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:07,760
I

1326
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:07,940
think.

1327
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,260
So

1328
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,380
we

1329
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,500
need

1330
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,600
to

1331
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,040
turn

1332
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,160
it

1333
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,480
into

1334
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,660
a

1335
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:09,800
Python

1336
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,020
float.

1337
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,520
So

1338
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:10,720
we

1339
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:10,920
save

1340
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,420
now.

1341
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:11,980
And

1342
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,400
because

1343
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,000
we

1344
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,460
run

1345
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,720
our

1346
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:13,940

1347
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,160

1348
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,440

1349
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,740

1350
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:14,960
it

1351
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,340
detected

1352
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,540
the

1353
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:15,940
change

1354
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,220
in

1355
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,460
this

1356
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,760
file.

1357
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,100
And

1358
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,340
it

1359
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,820
reloaded

1360
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,320

service.

1363
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,240
So

1364
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,480
now

1365
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,560
we

1366
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,740
don't

1367
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,940
need

1368
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,060

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,320
stop

1370
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,480
it.

1371
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,600
We

1372
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,780
don't

1373
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,040
need

1374
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,300
to

1375
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,400
start

1376
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,820

1377
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,080

1378
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,480
It

1379
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:22,720
automatically

1380
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,600
restarted

1381
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,040
it.

1382
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,460
Now

1383
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:24,900
let's

1384
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,360
invoke

1385
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,480
it

1386
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,780
again.

1387
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,320
And

1388
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,420
now

1389
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,660
the

1390
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,000
response

1391
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,180
is

1392
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,600
200,

1393
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,160
meaning

1394
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,520
that

1395
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:28,860
it

1396
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,080
was

1397
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,600
successful.

1398
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,000
And

1399
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,200
we

1400
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,420
see

1401
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,740
this

1402
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:30,940

1403
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,000

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,600
well.

1407
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:31,880
So

1408
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:31,980
there

1409
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,220
was

1416
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,159
It

1417
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,360
ended

1418
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,600
up

1419
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,020

1421
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,059
200.

1422
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,539
Don't

1423
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,700
see

1424
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:36,840

1426
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,500
the

1427

1428
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:37,820

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:37,980
the

1431
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,520
here.

1432
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:38,780
We

1433
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,039
know

1434
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,220
that

1435
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,460
this

1436
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,960

1438
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,179
So

1439
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,320
we

1440
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,460
can

1441
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,860
just

1442
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
use

1443
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:41,700
this

1444
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,140
dot

1445
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,640
JSON

1446
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,000
thing

1447
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,100
that

1448
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,740
will

1449
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:43,840
take

1450
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,360
the

1451
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,580

1452
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:44,980

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,320
the

request

1455
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,060
and

1456
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,340
turn

1457
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,640
it

1458
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,140
into

1459
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,380

1462
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,060
And

1463
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,340
this

1464
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,500
is

1465
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,600
what

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:49,840
have.

1468
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,160
So

1469
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,360
this

1470
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,480
is

1471
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,600
what

1472
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,700
we

1473
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:50,920
send

1474
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,160

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,440

1476
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,640

1478
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,260
This

1479
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,380
is

1480
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,560
our

1482
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,440
And

1483
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,940
we

1484
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,200
are

1485
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,540
able

1486
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,640

1493
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,180
Let's

1494
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,140
say

1495
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,280
if

1496
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,680

we

can

1502
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,760
do

1503
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,060
something

1504
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,700
like

1505
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:02,840
if

1506
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,040
response

1507
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,920

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,520
is

1509
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,900
true,

1510
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,680
then

1511
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:07,720
send

1512
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:07,940

1518
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,460
I

1519
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,640
don't

1520
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:11,860
think

1521
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,000
we

1522
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,120
have

1523
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,420
a

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,740

1525
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,280
ID.

1526
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's

1527
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,740
say

1528
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:14,840
XYZ123.

1529
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,620
Of

1530
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:16,780
course,

1531
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:16,900
it

1532
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,100
doesn't

1533
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,380
know

1534
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,540
what

1535
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,700
is

1536
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,880
that.

1537
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,500
But

1538
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:18,720
this

1539
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,900
is

1540
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,240
customer

1541
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,340
ID.

1542
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,460
And

1543
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,840
if

1544
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
here

1545
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,700
we

1546
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,940
have

1547
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,660
tenor,

1548
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,160
24

1549
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,620
months,

1550
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,240
then

1551
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,360
the

1552
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
response,

1553
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,640
yeah,

1554
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I

1555
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:25,740
think

1556
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,020
we

1557
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,240
also

1558
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,360
need

1559
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,500
to

1560
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,680
adjust

1561
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,240
that.

1562
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,460
Total

1563
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,840
charges

1564
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:27,940
because

1565
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,300
it

1566
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,560
would

1567
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:28,860
be

1568
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,440
24

1569
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,860
times

1570
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,280
more.

1571
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,260
Yeah,

1572
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,360
so

1573
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:32,660
you

1574
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,000
see

1575
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,240
that

1576
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,400
the

1577
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,560
customer

1578
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:33,880
is

1579
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,320
not

1580
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,500
churning.

1581
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,880
So

1582
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:34,960
we

1583
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,120
are

1584
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,420
not

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,680

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,140
this

1591
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,520
customer.

1592
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:37,820
This

1593
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:37,920
is

1594
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,060
how

1595
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,220
we

1596
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,560

1597
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,080

1604
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,320
So

1605
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,700
let

1606
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:42,800
me

1607
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,060
just

1608
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,280
stop

1609

1610

and

1611
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:43,860

1614
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,520
When

1617
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,220
this,

1618
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,440
we

1619
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,720

1620
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,080

This

1640
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,260
If

you

1642
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,200
were

1650
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,580
so

1651
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,680
what

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,320
it

1696
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,600
first.

1697
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,800
I

1698
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,380
installed

1699
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,520
it

1700
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,120
previously.

1701
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,500
So

1702
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,760
that's

1703
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,920
why

1704
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,020
it

1705
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,380
uses

1706
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,500
a

1707
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,840
cached

1708
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,600
version.

1709
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:15,920
So

1710
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:15,960
I

1711
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,120
didn't

1712
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,220
need

1713
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,400
to

1714
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,700
download

1715
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:16,960
it.

1716
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,120
But

1717
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,400
yeah,

1718
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,520
so

1719
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,940
now

1720
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,280
it

1721
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,860
installed

1722
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,140
it

1723
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,360
again.

1724
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,620
The

1725
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:19,880
way

1726
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,160
we

1727
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,500
use

1728
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,900
gunicorn

1729
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,360
is

1730
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,860
we

1731
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,320
use

1732
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,540
it

1733
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:22,800
in

1734
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,020
gunicorn.

1735
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,000
So

1736
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,140
we

1737
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,300
need

1738
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,620
to

1739
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,000
tell

1740
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,540
gunicorn

1741
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,480
where

1742
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,800
our

1743
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,160

1744
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,300
app

1745
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,700
is.

1746
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,080
Our

1747
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,460
flask

1748
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,560
app

1749
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:28,980
is

1750
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,700
in

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,300
app.

1753
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,720
So

1754
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,020
this

1755
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,180
thing

1756
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,660
here

1757
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:31,980
means

1758
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,420
that

1759
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,600
our

1760
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:32,820
app

1761
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,140
is

1762
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,560
here.

1763
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:33,860
So

1764
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,080
use

1765
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,460
that.

1766
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:34,840
The

1767
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,020

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,520
file

1769
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,800
where

1770
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,200
it

1771
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,640
needs

1772
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:36,820
to

1773
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,120
go

1774
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,320

.py.

1777
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,560
So

1778
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,720
we

1779
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,900
write

1780
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,220
predict

1781
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,420
and

1782
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:39,600
the

1783
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:39,920
variable

1784
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,180
it

1785
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,380
is

1786
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,720
interested

1787
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:40,940
in

1788
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,220
is

1789
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,480
app.

1790
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:41,860
And

1791
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:41,980
then

1792
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,080
we

1793
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,320
also

1794
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,440
need

1795
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:42,680
to

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:42,780
specify,

1797
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,560
so

1798
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:44,900
we

1799
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,040
don't

1800
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,320
need

1801
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,400

1804
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,340
Yeah,

1805
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,440
we

1806
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,620
just

1807
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,120
need

1808
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,380
to

1809
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,560
predict

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,460
app.

1811
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:48,980
And

1812
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,080
we

1813
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,400
also

1814
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,600
need

1815
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,740
to

1816
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,240
specify

1817
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,560
the

1818
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,900

1819
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,240
where

1820
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,720
this

1821
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:51,820
thing

1822
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,160
will

1823
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,260
live

1824
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,700
here.

1825
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,400
This

1826
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,680
thing

1827
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,060
here

1828
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,380
will

1829
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,540
not

1830
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:54,740
be

1831
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,140
executed

1832
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,440
because

1833
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,660
we

1834
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,940
put

1835
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,040
it

1836
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,460

00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:56,760

statement.

1840
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:57,840
So

1841
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,540
that's

1842
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:58,800
why

1843
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,180
here

1844
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,300
we

But

1849
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,080
it

1850
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:01,800

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,960
And

1904
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,160
we

1905
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,360
can

1906
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,580
test

1907
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:21,680
it.

1908
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:21,900
So

1909
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,380
it

1910
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,820
returns

1911
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,540
the

1912
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,660
same

1913
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,040
thing.

1914
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,360
So

1915
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,540
this

1916
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,740
is

1917
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,880
how

1918
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,060
you

1919
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,500
turn

1920
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,180

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,360

1922
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,600

1923
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,220
into

1924
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,200
something

1925
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,660
production

1926
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:29,920
ready.

1927
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,240
And

1928
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,460
this

1929
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,600
is

1930
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,720
what

1931
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:30,820
we

1932
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,040
will

1933
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,160
next

1934
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,680
use

1935
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,440

1936
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,140

1937
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,440

services.

1939
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,340
I

1940
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,560
know

1941
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,740
that

1942
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,000
many

1943
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,140
of

1944
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,360
you

1945
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,580
are

1946
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:35,820
using

1947
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,080
Windows.

1948
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,620
I

1949
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,960
actually

1950
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,340
also

1951
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,560
use

1952
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,920
Windows,

1953
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,180
as

1954
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,380
you

1955
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,580
can

1956
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:38,880
see.

1957
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,240
This

1958
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,660
is

1959
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:39,660
a

1960
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:39,940
Linux

1961
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,440
subsystem.

1962
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,660
If

1963
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,200
you're

1964
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,600
using

1965
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,080
plain

1966
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Windows,

1967
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,220
gunicorn

1968
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,700

1969
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:43,920
not

1970
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,240
work.

1971
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:44,580
So

1972
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,060
gunicorn

1973
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,620
uses

1974
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,220
some

1975
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,060

1976
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,300

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,180
features.

1980
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:49,660
So

1981
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:49,900
it

1982
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,340
works

1983
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,660
on

1984
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:50,800
macOS.

1985
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,060
It

1986
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,440
works

1987
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,960
on

1988
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Linux.

1989
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:52,680
But

1990
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:52,780
it

1991
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,040
doesn't

1992

Windows.

1995
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,040
So

1996
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,140
if

1997
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,500
you

I

2021
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,440
So

2022
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,600
now

2023
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,700
I

this

2040
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,920

you

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,600

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,820

2118
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,260
which

2119
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,440
I

2120
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,900
recommend

2121
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,280
doing,

2122
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,500
you

2123
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,600
should

2124
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,040
definitely

2125
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,260
do

2126
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,480
this

2127
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,580
if

2128
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,140
you're

2129
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,140
on

2130
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,660
Windows.

2131
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:45,800
But

2132
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,080
if

2133
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,200
for

2134
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,420
some

2135
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,680
reasons

2136
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:46,820
you

2137
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:46,960
do

2138
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,060
not

2139
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,320
want

2140
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,420
to

2141
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:47,540
do

2142
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:47,720
this,

2143
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:47,880
you

2144
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,100
can

2145
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,360
use

2146
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,520
an

2147
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,160
alternative.

2148
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,540
It's

2149
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,760
called

2150
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,280

2153
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,740
It's

2154
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:53,940
very

2155
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,240
similar

2156
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,540

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,040

2158
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,620

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,000
install

2160
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,160
it.

2161
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,600
And

2162
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,080
then

2163
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,460
you

2164
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:57,900
use

2165
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,000
it

2166
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,240
very

2167
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,800
similarly

2168
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:58,980
to

00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,940
gunicorn.

2170
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,420
Let

2171
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,640
me

2172
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,000
just

2173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,420
get

2175
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,500

2179
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:03,920
And

2180
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,180

2181
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,740

2183
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,060
I

2184
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,160
think

2185
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,420
we

2186
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,600
need

2187
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:05,800
to

2188
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:05,960
use

2189
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,060
something

2190
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,600
else.

2191
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:06,760
Let

2192
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,960
me

2193
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,240
quickly

2194
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,460
Google

2195
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,380
it.

2196
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,320
Instead

2197
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,860
of

2198
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:12,860
writing

2200
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,680
we

2201
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:13,840
write

2202
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,480

2204
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,040
And

2205
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,180
then

2206
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,380

2212
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,680
So

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,980

Yeah,

2223
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,200
so

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,380

2229
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,500

2321
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,440
yesterday

2322
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,880
when

2323
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,060
scikit

2324
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,440

2325
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,060

2326
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,660

2331
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,320
But

2332
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:13,800
for

2333
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,220
my

2334
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,420
Linux,

2335
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,660
I

2336
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:14,820
installed

2337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,320
it

2338
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,760
a

2339
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:15,960
month

2340
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,420
ago

2341
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,600
or

2342
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,280
something

2343
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,380
like

2344
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,800
this.

2345
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,060
So

2346
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,220
it's

2347
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,380
the

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,620

2349
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:18,840
before.

2350
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,520
And

2351
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,000
scikit

2352
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,300

2353

that.

2356
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:21,760
So

2357
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:21,760
it

2358
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,120
says,

2359
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,360
hey,

2360
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,900
be

2361
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,440
careful.

2362
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,760
The

I

2369
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,160

2372
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,120
different.

2373
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,480
That's

2374
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,920
why

2375
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,320
use

2376
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,640

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,180
risk

2382
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,420
because

2383
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:29,660
the

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,540
the

2388
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,220

2393
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,020
It's

2394
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,160
not

2395
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:33,740
actually

safe.

2397
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,500
That's

2398
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,620
why

2399
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:34,800
there

2400
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:34,920

Okay,

2404
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,620
so

2405
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,080
I

2406
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,500
cannot

2407
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,980
really

2408
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,480
now

2409
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,780
use

2410
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,100

2429
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,360
So

2430
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,480
what

2431
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm

2432
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:46,800

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,000
It's

2448
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:52,800
And

2449
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,820
I

2450
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,180
will

2451
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,280
put

2452
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,100

2454
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,660

2457
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,180
Rename

2458
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,400

2459
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,040

2462
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,040
It's

2463
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,640
probably

2464
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:00,980
a

2466
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,020
I

2467
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,120
will

2468
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,360
just

2469
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,740

2475
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:04,580
And

2476
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:04,840
let

2477
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,060
me

2478
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,340

2483
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:07,920
So

2484
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,300
I'll

2485
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,480
do

2486
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,580

Here

2492
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,860
we

2493
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:10,960
have

2494
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,280

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,300
here.

2497
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,040
And

2498
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,300
we

2499
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,580
have

2500
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,860

2502
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:15,740
So

2503
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,900
what

2504
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,020
I

2505
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,160

I

2510
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,000
just

2511
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,260
want

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,420

2516
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,000
So

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Let's

2527
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:26,700
just

2528
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,060
write

2529
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,200
it

2530
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,560
here.

2531
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Customer

2532
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,180
ID

2533
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,280
is

2534
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:29,820
XYZ123.

2535
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,920
Put

2536
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,060
it

2537
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,500
here.

2538
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Okay,

2539
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,020
so

2540
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,160
we

2541
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,280
have

2542
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,540
this

2543
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:37,700
code

2544
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,000
now.

2545
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,220
And

2546
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,440
cleaned

2547
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,600
it

2548
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,720
a

2549
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,040
little

2550
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,320
bit.

2551
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:41,860
So

2552
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,020
now

2553
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,380
let's

2554
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,580
run

2555
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,000
this.

2556
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,520
So

2557
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,600
we

2558
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,720
have

2559
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,140
another

2560
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,740
command

2561
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,080
prompt.

2562
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:45,780
So

2563
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm

2564
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:45,980
in

2565
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,180
the

2566
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,280
same

2567
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,780
directory.

2568
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,440
So

2569
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,700
I

2570
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:47,900
need

2571
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,240
to

2572
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,560
run

2573
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,000
predict

2574
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:49,940
test.

2575
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,460
So

2576
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:51,920
now

2577
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,400
it

2578
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,680
was

2579
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:52,900
able

2580
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,120
to

2581
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,640
communicate

2582
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,500
with

2583
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,600
Waitress

2584
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:54,780
with

2585
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,420
this

2586
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,940
process

2587
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,440
and

2588
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,700
get

2589
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:56,940
back

2590
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,520
the

2591
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,520
predictions.

2592
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay,

2593
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,080
I

2594
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,300
think

2595
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,780
that's

2596
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,200
it

2597
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,340
for

2598
00:15:59,540 --> 00:15:59,920
this

2599
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,240
lesson.

2600
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,800
This

2601
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,300
lesson

2602
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,700
we

2603
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,220
turned

2604
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,660
our

2605
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,020

2609
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,560

application.

2612
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,600
And

2613
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,700
then

2614
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,880
we

2615
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,100
saw

2616
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,200
how

2617
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,560
to

2618
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,740

2619
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:06,840

2620
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,140
with

2621
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,590

2622
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,200
Then

2623
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,920
we

2624
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,100
put

2625
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,660
it

2626
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:09,880
in

2627
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,220

And

2636
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:13,720
then

2637
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:13,900
we

2638
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,040
saw

2639
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,220

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:14,740
also

2642
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:14,940
do

2643
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,120
