00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.700
and

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.900
in

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.180
this

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.420
lesson

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.620
we

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.720
will

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.940
talk

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.300
about

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.640
serving

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:05.840
the

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.080
churn

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.180
model

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.860
with

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.920
Flask.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.460
Previously

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.119
we

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:08.740
created

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.940
a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.160
script

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.580
for

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.840
saving

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.060
a

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.360
model,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.520
for

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.920
training

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.120
a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.260
model

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.460
and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.680
saving

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.880
it

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.040
to

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.240
a

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.380
pickle

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.760
file,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.140
and

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.320
we

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.680
also

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.880
talked,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.680
already

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.900
talked

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.240
about

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.600
Flask

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.700
and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:16.300
creating

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.480
a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.800
simple

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.000
web

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.280
service

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.380
with

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.840
Flask.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.120
So

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.160
in

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.400
this

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.680
lesson

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.780
we

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.040
will

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.140
put

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.460
this

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.860
together

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.240
and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.480
we

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.780
will

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.320
take

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.880
our

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.300
predict

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.620
script

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.720
that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.980
we

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.160
have

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.780
and

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.040
turn

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.220
it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.600
into

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.900
a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.420
web

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.760
service.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.180
So

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.460
let's

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.620
start.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.100
What

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.220
we

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.380
want

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.460
to

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.680
do

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.100
is

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.220
we

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.440
want

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.580
to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.860
create

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.300
a

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:29.960
web

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.420
service,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.060
let's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.540
call

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.860
it

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.860
churn

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.340
service.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.280
So

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.440
this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.880
service

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.420
has

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.700
our

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.880
model,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.200
right,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.660
and

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.920
we

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.300
want

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.640
this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.900
model

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.000
to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.240
be

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.740
available

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.840
at

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.220
slash

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.860
predict

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.180
root,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.620
and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.060
then

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.340
let's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.800
say

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.880
we

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.100
have

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.600
our

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.420
marketing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.000
service

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.720
here,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.500
so

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.820
they

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.080
will

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.380
send

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.600
us

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.800
some

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.280
information

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.580
about

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.220
customers,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.040
so

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.240
it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.500
will

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.020
look

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.600
exactly

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.340
like

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.560
that.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.560
All

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.000
the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.800
information

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.120
we

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.160
know

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.420
about

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.560
the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.080
customers,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.620
and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.880
then

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.220
we

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.440
will

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.080
reply

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.500
them

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.200
with

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.320
basically

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.640
this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.280
probability

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.760
of

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.880
churning.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.980
This

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.099
is

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:04.220
what

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.360
we

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.459
want

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.560
to

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.739
do.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.959
We

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.080
want

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.239
to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.420
create

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.800
a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.800
predict

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.220
method

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.660
and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.980
then

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.400
put

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.520
it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.120
to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.600
the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.840
slash

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.940
predict

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.620
address.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.260
So

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.440
let's

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.780
do

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.980
that.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.760
So

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.980
we

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.240
have

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.600
this

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.140
function

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.240
we'll

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.740
call

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.120
predict.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.040
So

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.340
this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.780
function

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.140
meets

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.420
a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.040
customer,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.740
and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.920
then

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.280
we

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.580
simply

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.060
return

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.060
the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.800
predictions.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.080
So

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.760
this

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.940
is

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.060
what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.300
we

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.560
want

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.040
to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.400
now

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.860
turn

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.240
into

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.280
a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.440
web

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.760
service.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.780
So

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.960
let

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.140
me

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.420
remove

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.620
the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.000
customer

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.280
for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.520
a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.640
while.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.960
We'll

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.140
just

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.400
create

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.880
a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.320
different

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.620
file.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.980
So

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.060
what

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.240
we

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.440
need

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.820
here

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.340
now

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.340
is,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.260
let

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.300
me

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.460
remove

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.800
that.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.940
So

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.240
let

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.520
me

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.780
open

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.320
this

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.260
other

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.060
file

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.400
with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.740
our

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.900
web

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.240
service

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.780
and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.220
just

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.320
copy

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.800
everything.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.580
I'll

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.840
put

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.980
it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.360
here.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.180
So

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.680
let's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.260
add

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.040
Flask.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.380
Let's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.600
put

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.700
the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.800
import

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.720
here

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.840
at

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.020
the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.180
top,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.740
and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.420
then

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.520
we'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.960
create

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.060
a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.360
Flask

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.680
app.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.920
Let's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.460
do

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.620
it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.140
here.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.340
We

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.800
can

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.140
call

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.620
the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.940
app

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.900
churn,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.620
and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.840
we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.040
want

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.220
to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.540
put

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.840
it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.180
to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.900
the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.080
root

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.720
predict,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.420
and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.660
instead

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.920
of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.140
using

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.480
the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.480
get

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.720
method,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.220
we'll

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.520
use

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.900
here

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.220
post.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.420
So

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.600
the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.039
reason

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.280
for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.500
that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.680
is

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.919
because

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.100
we

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.280
want

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.460
to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.660
send

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.020
some

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.460
information

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.620
about

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.880
the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.320
customer,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.420
and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.900
we

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.200
cannot

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.540
easily

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.760
do

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.960
it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.560
with

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.660
a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.840
get

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.200
method.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.800
So

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.120
let

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.220
me

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.320
remove

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.000
this

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.300
pink

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.040
method

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.660
here,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.000
pink

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.480
function.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.140
When

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.760
we

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.960
send

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.180
this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.660
information,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.980
this

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.460
information

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.680
will

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.960
be

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.220
sent

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.800
in

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.340
JSON

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.760
format.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.960
So

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.280
the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.720
request,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.060
the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.320
body

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.440
of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.660
the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.940
request

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.040
will

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.660
contain

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.960
the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.380
features,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.660
the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.960
information

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.140
about

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.360
the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.540
customer

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.940
in

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.140
JSON

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.500
format,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.600
and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.020
the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.520
response

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.660
will

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.260
also

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.500
be

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.780
JSON.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.100
And

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.300
JSON

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.680
looks

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.240
exactly

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.620
like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.100
Python

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.700
dictionaries,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.680
except

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.640
here

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.900
instead

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.080
of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.360
single

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.760
quotes,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.200
we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.700
use

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.020
usual

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.120
quotes.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.800
So

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.940
let

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.100
me

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.220
just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.580
quickly

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.960
replace

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.060
it.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.680
So

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.100
now

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.520
this

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.140
is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.220
a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.580
JSON

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.680
document

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.460
that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.880
contains

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.080
some

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.360
fields.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.740
So

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.920
for

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.100
each

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.300
field,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.600
it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.920
contains

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.400
values.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.940
This

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.240
is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.600
JSON.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.920
And

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.340
this

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.460
is

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.560
what

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.720
we

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.840
want

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.040
to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.200
send

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.380
to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.620
our

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.800
web

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.160
service.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.960
And

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.580
unfortunately,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.180
in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.180
Flask,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.460
it's

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.620
not

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.940
as

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.260
easy

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.480
as

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.720
that.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.440
So

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.440
here

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.660
we

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.000
need

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.600
to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.280
tell

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.540
Flask

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.780
that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.920
we

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.040
are

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.320
getting

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.660
JSON,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.880
and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.080
we

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.260
want

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.380
to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.740
extract

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.440
the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.860
body

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.980
of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.220
the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.540
request

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.780
as

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.060
JSON.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.020
So

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.160
for

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.460
that,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.260
we

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.880
need

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.200
to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.680
import

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.740
special

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.880
helper

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.140
function

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.660
from

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.300
Flask

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.620
called

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.840
special

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.560
helper

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.240
utility

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.720
from

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.040
Flask

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.340
called

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.880
request.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.500
And

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.800
this

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.300
request

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.980
contains

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.080
the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.780

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.100
about

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.200
the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.580
request.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.980
So

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.040
for

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.760
example,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.920
we

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.340
can

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.640
do

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.000
this,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.380
get

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.640
JSON,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.080
and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.280
it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.420
will

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.820
return

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.960
the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.240

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.440
of

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.520
the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.900
request

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.620
as

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.940
a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.060
Python

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.460
dictionary.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.780
So

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.880
it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.140
will

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.440
take

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.040
the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.480

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.600
of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.740
the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.060
request,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.340
it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.660
will

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.060
assume

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.240
that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.600
it's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.860
JSON,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.100
it

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.300
will

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.560
parse

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.720
it,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.060
and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.220
it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.360
will

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.600
turn

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.740
it

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.080
into

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.160
a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.360
Python

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.820
dictionary.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.520
And

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.960
so

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.080
it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.360
will

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.880
now

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.700
return

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.860
it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.120
as

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.220
a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.760
customer.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.280
Our

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.600
response

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.780
is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.040
also

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.320
JSON.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.780
So

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.900
we

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.000
need

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.300
to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.040
prepare

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.140
our

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.980

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.240
So

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.340
it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.500
will

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.800
be,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.020
let's

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.300
say,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.720

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.480

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.440

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.120
our

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.980
pret.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.660
And

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.020
maybe

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.400
also

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.840
because

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.820
our

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.440
will

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.940
now

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.140
need

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.320
to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.480
make

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.660
a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.500
whether

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.200
they

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.520
want

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.640
to

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.920
send

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.700
not.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.880
Marketing

service

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.740
doesn't

really

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.340
know

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.680
if

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.120
we

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.280
should

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.760
use

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.200
0

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.780

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.560
or

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.240

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.060
.75

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.400
.9.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.500
It

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.800
doesn't

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.020
know.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.720
So

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.780
we

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.980
don't

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.980
want

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.480
that.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.980
So

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.100
we

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.340
want

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.520
to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.660
make

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.940
here

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.280
in

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.480
our

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.960
Let's

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.120
make

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.340
this

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.800
decision.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.700
Churn,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.260
and

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.060
we'll

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.360
use

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.860
the

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.940

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.880
So

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.079
it

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.260
will

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.640
be

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.080
true

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.680
if

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.280
it's

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.060

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.740
otherwise.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.340
So

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.420
we

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.600
want

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.220
that.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.820
So

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.980
now

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.160
this

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.340

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.400
we

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.620
want

turn

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.000
And

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.280
for

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.500
that,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.020
there

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.020

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.880
We

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.980
now

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.660
just

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.600
invoke

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.100
Yeah,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.260
so

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.460
it's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.720

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.760
had

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.160
here.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.520
So

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.780
this

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.040
is

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.060
our

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.320
core

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.600
logic,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.020
turning

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.320
a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.700
customer

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.300
into

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.980
a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.240
feature

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.660
matrix,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.000
then

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.100
invoking

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.640
a

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.820
model,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.140
and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.460
then

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.500
deciding

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.700
if

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.120
this

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.420
customer

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.560
is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.700
going

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.920
to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.000
churn

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.140
or

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.240
not.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.560
We

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.240
actually

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.740
probably

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.040
want

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.260
to

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.520
put

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.980
this

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.680
logic

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.780
in

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.100
a

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.200
separate

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.740
function.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.260
I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.380
will

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.480
not

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.680
do

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.860
it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.160
here,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.440
but

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.900
for

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.200
a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.340
real

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.700
project,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.900
I

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.060
would

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.280
put

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.540
this

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.840
away

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.300
inside

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.540
a

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.800
separate

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.300
function.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.800
So

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.860
here

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.980
we

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.280
have

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.540
only

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.640
some

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.620
weather

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.860
plate

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.220
code,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.460
like

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.660
getting

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.880
the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.360
customer

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.520
from

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.020
JSON

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.300
and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.800
then

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.200
JSONify

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.420
the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.620
result.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.140
And

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.340
the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.460
core

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.760
logic

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.020
will

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.480
be

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.860
inside

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.960
a

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.320
different

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.680
function.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.920
I'll

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.080
keep

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.160
it

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.440
here

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.580
like

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.820
that.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.440
So

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.500
let's

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.660
just

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.940
test

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.100
it.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.460
I

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.720
think

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.220
here

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.420
we

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.600
will

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.840
now

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.040
have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.480
an

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.840
error,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.020
and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.300
I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.460
just

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.560
want

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.020
you

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.260
to

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.500
see

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.760
this

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.000
error

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.200
before

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.560
we

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.760
fix

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.860
it.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.300
So

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.580
let's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.800
run

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.900
it.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.160
So

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.340
we

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.620
have

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.900
this

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.560
Python

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.140
predict.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.420
So

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.060
it

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.260
run

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.580
our

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.200
application

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.660
and

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.860
it

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.060
is

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.480
available.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.080
So

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.720
now

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.020
we

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.440
want

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.860
to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.420
communicate

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.520
with

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.200
this

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.680
web

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.980
service.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.300
So

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.400
now

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.600
let's

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.040
pretend

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.440
we're

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.540
this

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.000
marketing

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.480
service,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.880
and

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.160
we

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.560
will

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.280
pretend

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.700
from

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.820
a

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.040

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.280
notebook.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.100
So

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.380
let

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.520
me

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.680
just

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.040
create

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.240
a

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.400
new

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.680
notebook.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.240
I'll

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.700
call

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.800
it

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.200
0

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.880
.5

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.540

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.060
test.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.200
So

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.680
from

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.960
this

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.060
notebook,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.820
we

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.000
want

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.500
to

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.040
communicate

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.140

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.100
And

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.480
remember

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.900
previously

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.220
with

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.640
this

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.780
ping

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.060
pong

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.600
service,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.720
we

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.880
could

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.100
just

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.400
do

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.640
this

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.860
from

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.180
our

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.560
browser.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.020
Here

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.220
it's

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.360
not

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.560
the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.900
case,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.320
because

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.760
in

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.960
the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.240
browser,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.500
when

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.740
you

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.380
enter

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.940
like

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.120
696

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.620
predict,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.140
it

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.300
will

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.640
now

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.000
say

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.460
method

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.660
is

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.780
not

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.080
allowed,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.580
because

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.020
a

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.320
browser

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.580
is

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.860

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.660
request.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.020
So

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.020
you

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.220
can

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.400
see

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.580
this

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.860
in

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.860
the

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.100
logs.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.760
So

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.860
the

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.460
browser

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.640
is

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.800
trying

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.800
to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.800
get

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.800
a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.800
get

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.800
request.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.660
But

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.260
it

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.980
says

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.240
405,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.820
meaning

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.940
the

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.380
method

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.620
is

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.740
not

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.060
allowed.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.320
The

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.600
only

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.860
allowed

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.260
method

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.200
here

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.300
is

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.760
post.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.040
So

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.120
we

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.260
need

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.380
to

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.540
send

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.660
a

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.800
post

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.140
request.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.440
And

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.580
from

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.760
the

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.160
browser,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.480
it's

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.580
not

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.120
easy.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.640
So

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.860
what

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.980
we

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.120
want

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.200
to

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.320
do

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.440
is

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.520
we

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.620
want

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.800
to

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.960
do

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.060
it

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.260
from

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.540
Python.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.840
And

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.980
for

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.160
that,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.340
there

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.460
is

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.640
a

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.740
great

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.120
library

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.480
called

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.820
requests.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.620
So

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.820
we'll

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.120
use

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.400
that.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.800
Let's

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.960
say

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.140
our

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.900
URL

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.520
is

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.000
http

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.540
localhost

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.500
9696

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.000
predict.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.860
Let's

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.100
take

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.380
our

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.040
customer.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.640
Customer

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.840
we

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.980
want

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.160
to

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.420
send.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.020
I

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.080
think

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.540
I

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.740
saved

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.840
this

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.460
customer

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.800
here.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.000
So

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.820
this

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.960
is

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.060
our

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.760
customer.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.160
By

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.320
the

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.580
way,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.000
as

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.140
you

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.660
see,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.120
JSON

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.800
here

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.080
turned

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.180
out

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.580
to

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.900
be

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.000
a

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.280
valid

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.620
Python

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.040
dictionary.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.580
So

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.680
we

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.860
have

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.300
this

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.760
customer

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.280
here.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.600
So

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.740
what

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.860
we

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.020
want

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.120
to

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.240
do

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.500
now

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.700
is

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.800
we

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.000
want

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.640
to

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.860
send

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.200
this

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.800
customer

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.140
in

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.380
a

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.480
post

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.880
request.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.480
So

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.680
for

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.900
that,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.160
we

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.380
use

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.540
requests.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.340
And

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.540
then

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.720
there

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.840
is

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.040
a

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.400
function

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.500
called

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.060
posts.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.560
And

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.740
then

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.880
it

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.120
needs

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.320
a

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.680
URL,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.060
this

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.420
URL.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.960
And

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.540
we

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.220
say

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.380
that

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.540
we

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.720
want

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.840
to

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.040
send

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.300
this

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.820
dictionary

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.360
as

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.720
JSON.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.280
Now

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.520
you

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.740
see

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.080
the

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.600
response

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.800
with

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.400
500.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.740
So

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.980
this

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.180
is

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.440
an

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.660
error.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.060
So

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.180
and

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.540
remember,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.060
I

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.280
told

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.540
you

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.720
that

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.940
there

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.040
will

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.280
be

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.460
an

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.680
error.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.780
And

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.120
I

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.400
want

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.700
you

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.900
to

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.000
see

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.260
this

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.360
error.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.660
So

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.720
it

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.960
says

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.260
object

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.360
of

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.980
type

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.080
bool

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.360
is

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.460
not

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.280
JSON

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.760
serializable.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.260
It

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.380
could

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.620
be

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.860
quite

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.340
confusing.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.620
And

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:34.840
the

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.960
reason

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.180
for

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.360
that

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.540
is

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.900
this

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.200
bool

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.580
underscore

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.060
is

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.320
something

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.500
that

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.680
is

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.780
coming

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.360
from

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.540
NumPy.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.320
But

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.740
the

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.020
JSON

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.480
class

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.580
in

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.300
Python,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.700
so

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:41.960
see

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.380
this

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.880
JSON,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.220
doesn't

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.400
know

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.660
how

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.160
to

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.460
turn

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.660
the

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.000
objects

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.120
of

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.460
this

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.800
class

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.300
into

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.160
text.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.660
But

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:48.800
it

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.060
knows

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.180
how

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.560
to

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:49.900
turn

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.500
usual

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.940
Python

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.320
booleans

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.440
into

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:51.920
text.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.440
So

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.660
we

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.800
need

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.980
to

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.120
do

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.520
now

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.120
is

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.520
wrap

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.860
this

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.140
churn

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.240
into

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.500
boolean.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.360
So

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:57.720
this

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:57.920
will

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.380
turn

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.020
the

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.040
NumPy

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.540
boolean

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.240
into

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.600
a

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.840
usual

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.080
Python

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.500
boolean.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.700
And

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.040
this

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.180
ypret

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.240
is

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.800
also,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.240
I

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.380
think,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.620
from

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:04.840
NumPy.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:05.520
So

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.780
this

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.300
is

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.300
a

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.460
float

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:06.560
64,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:07.760
I

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:07.940
think.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.260
So

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.380
we

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.500
need

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.600
to

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.040
turn

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.160
it

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.480
into

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.660
a

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:09.800
Python

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.020
float.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.520
So

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:10.720
we

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:10.920
save

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.420
now.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.980
And

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.400
because

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.000
we

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.460
run

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:13.720
our

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:13.940
flask

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.160
in

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.440
debug

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.740
mode,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:14.960
it

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.340
detected

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.540
the

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:15.940
change

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.220
in

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:16.460
this

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.760
file.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.100
And

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.340
it

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:17.820
reloaded

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.320
the

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:18.660
web

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:18.820
service.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.240
So

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.480
now

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:19.560
we

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.740
don't

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:19.940
need

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.060
to

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.320
stop

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:20.480
it.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.600
We

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.780
don't

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.040
need

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.300
to

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.400
start

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:21.820
it

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.080
again.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.480
It

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:22.720
automatically

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.600
restarted

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.040
it.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.460
Now

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.900
let's

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.360
invoke

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.480
it

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:25.780
again.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.320
And

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.420
now

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:26.660
the

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.000
response

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.180
is

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.600
200,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.160
meaning

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.520
that

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.860
it

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.080
was

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.600
successful.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.000
And

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.200
we

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.420
see

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.740
this

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:30.940
in

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.000
the

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.100
logs

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.380
as

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.600
well.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:31.880
So

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:31.980
there

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.220
was

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.400
a

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.539
post

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:32.900
request

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.159
to

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.340
slash

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.700
predict.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.159
It

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.360
ended

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.600
up

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.020
being

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.400
successful,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.059
200.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.539
Don't

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:36.700
see

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.840
the

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.080
content,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:37.500
the

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.679
body

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:37.820
of

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:37.980
the

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.220
response

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.520
here.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:38.780
We

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.039
know

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.220
that

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:39.460
this

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:39.960
is

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:39.960
JSON.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:40.179
So

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.320
we

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.460
can

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.860
just

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.600
use

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:41.700
this

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.140
dot

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.640
JSON

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.000
thing

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.100
that

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.740
will

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:43.840
take

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.360
the

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.580
content

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:44.980
of

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.320
the

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.720
request

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.060
and

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.340
turn

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.640
it

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.140
into

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.380
a

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:47.680
Python

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.040
dictionary.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.060
And

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.340
this

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.500
is

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:49.600
what

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:49.740
we

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.840
have.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.160
So

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.360
this

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.480
is

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.600
what

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.700
we

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:50.920
send

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.160
back

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.440
from

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.640
the

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:51.940

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.260
This

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.380
is

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.560
our

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:52.800
response.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.440
And

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.940
we

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.200
are

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.540
able

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:54.640
to

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.280
get

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.520
this

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:55.880
response

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:55.980
from

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.320
the

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.660
service.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.180
Let's

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.140
say

00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.280
if

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.680
we're

the

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.000
service,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.320
we

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.560
can

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.760
do

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.060
something

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.700
like

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:02.840
if

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.040
response

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.920
churn

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.520
is

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.900
true,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.680
then

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:07.720
send

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:07.940
in

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.500
from

email

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.840
to

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.460
I

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:11.640
don't

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:11.860
think

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.000
we

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.120
have

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:12.420
a

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:12.740
customer

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.280
ID.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.000
Let's

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.740
say

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:14.840
XYZ123.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:16.620
Of

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:16.780
course,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:16.900
it

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.100
doesn't

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:17.380
know

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:17.540
what

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:17.700
is

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:17.880
that.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.500
But

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:18.720
this

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:18.900
is

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.240
customer

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.340
ID.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.460
And

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:20.840
if

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.520
here

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:21.700
we

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:21.940
have

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.660
tenor,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.160
24

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.620
months,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.240
then

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.360
the

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.960
response,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:25.640
yeah,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:25.640
I

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:25.740
think

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.020
we

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.240
also

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.360
need

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:26.500
to

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:26.680
adjust

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.240
that.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.460
Total

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.840
charges

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.940
because

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.300
it

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.560
would

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:28.860
be

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.440
24

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.860
times

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.280
more.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.260
Yeah,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.360
so

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:32.660
you

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.000
see

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.240
that

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.400
the

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.560
customer

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:33.880
is

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.320
not

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.500
churning.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:34.880
So

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:34.960
we

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.120
are

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.420
not

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.680
sending

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:35.860
a

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.340
promotional

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:36.680
email

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.780
to

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.140
this

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.520
customer.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:37.820
This

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:37.920
is

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.060
how

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.220
we

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:38.560
turned

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.080
our

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.240
predict

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:39.700
script

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.480
into

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.780
a

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:40.880
web

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.260
service.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.320
So

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.700
let

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:42.800
me

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.060
just

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.280
stop

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.480
it

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.680
and

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:43.860
start

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:43.960
it

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.300
again.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.520
When

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.720
we

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:44.900
do

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.220
this,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:45.440
we

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:45.720
see

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.080
that

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.440
warning.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.060
This

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.600
is

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.700
a

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.060
development

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.780
service.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.060
Do

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.240
not

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.480
use

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:49.680
it

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:49.780
in

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.280
production

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.640
deployment.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.360
Use

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.480
it

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.700
in

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.080
production

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.540
VSGI

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:52.800
service.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.260
If

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.000
you

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.200
were

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.600
wondering

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:54.820
what

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.040
to

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.320
do

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.420
in

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.580
this

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.020
case,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.580
so

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:56.680
what

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.000
we

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.160
need

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.260
to

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.460
do

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.720
here

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.240
is

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.460
instead

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:58.740
of

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.160
using

00:09:59.540 --> 00:09:59.760
plain

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.120
flask,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.340
we

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.500
need

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:00.680
to

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.060
use,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.420
basically

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:01.600
it

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:01.720
says

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:01.820
what

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.020
we

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.160
need

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.240
to

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.340
use,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.280
VSGI

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.620
server

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:03.980
instead.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.280
There

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.460
are

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:04.820
many

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.200
different

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.500
VSGI

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.040
servers

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:06.620
available

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.300
in

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.300
Python.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.800
I

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.320
usually

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:08.740
use

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.180
gunicorn.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:09.660
We

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:09.780
need

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:09.940
to

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.200
install

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.320
it

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:10.600
first.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:11.800
I

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.380
installed

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.520
it

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.120
previously.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.500
So

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:13.760
that's

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:13.920
why

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.020
it

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.380
uses

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.500
a

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:14.840
cached

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.600
version.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:15.920
So

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:15.960
I

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.120
didn't

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.220
need

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:16.400
to

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.700
download

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:16.960
it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.120
But

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.400
yeah,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.520
so

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:17.940
now

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.280
it

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.860
installed

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.140
it

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.360
again.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:19.620
The

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:19.880
way

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.160
we

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.500
use

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.900
gunicorn

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.360
is

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.860
we

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.320
use

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.540
it

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:22.800
in

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.020
gunicorn.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.000
So

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.140
we

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.300
need

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:24.620
to

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.000
tell

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.540
gunicorn

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.480
where

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.800
our

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.160
flask

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.300
app

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.700
is.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.080
Our

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.460
flask

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:28.560
app

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:28.980
is

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.700
in

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.020
predict

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.300
app.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:30.720
So

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.020
this

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.180
thing

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.660
here

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.980
means

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.420
that

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.600
our

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:32.820
app

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.140
is

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:33.560
here.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:33.860
So

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.080
use

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.460
that.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:34.840
The

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.020
Python

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:35.520
file

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.800
where

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.200
it

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.640
needs

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:36.820
to

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.120
go

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.320
is

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:37.760
predict

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:37.860
.py.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:38.560
So

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:38.720
we

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:38.900
write

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.220
predict

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.420
and

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:39.600
the

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.920
variable

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.180
it

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.380
is

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.720
interested

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:40.940
in

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.220
is

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.480
app.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:41.860
And

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:41.980
then

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.080
we

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.320
also

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.440
need

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:42.680
to

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:42.780
specify,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.560
so

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:44.900
we

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.040
don't

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.320
need

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:45.400
to

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.540
run

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.000
here.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.340
Yeah,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:46.440
we

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.620
just

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.120
need

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.380
to

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:47.560
predict

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.460
app.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:48.980
And

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.080
we

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.400
also

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:49.600
need

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.740
to

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.240
specify

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.560
the

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:50.900
address

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.240
where

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.720
this

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.820
thing

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.160
will

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.260
live

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.700
here.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.400
This

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.680
thing

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.060
here

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.380
will

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.540
not

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.740
be

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.140
executed

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.440
because

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.660
we

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:55.940
put

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.040
it

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.460
inside

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:56.760
this

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:56.960
if

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.060
statement.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.840
So

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.540
that's

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:58.800
why

00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.180
here

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.300
we

00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.460
have

00:10:59.560 --> 00:10:59.800
debug

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.100
true.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.780
But

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.080
it

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:01.800
doesn't

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.280
matter

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.620
for

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:02.880
gunicorn

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.300
because

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.700
this

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:03.920
line

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.080
will

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.280
not

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.460
be

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:04.620
executed

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.220
when

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.460
we

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.580
run

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:05.800
it

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.500
gunicorn.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.480
So

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.820
this

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:08.960
is

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.000
what

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.100
we

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.320
do.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:09.980
Gunicorn,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:10.500
bind,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.000
then

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.360
the

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.040
address,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.360
and

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.520
then

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:12.620
the

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.220
location

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:13.640
for

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:13.800
app.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.200
And

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.700
we

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.040
run

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.140
it

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.400
this

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:15.580
way.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.400
So

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:16.680
here

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:16.780
you

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.060
don't

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.200
see

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.440
any

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:17.740

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.340
because

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.800
gunicorn

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.340
is

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.740

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:19.840

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.400
production.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.960
And

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.160
we

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.360
can

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.580
test

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:21.680
it.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:21.900
So

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.380
it

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.820
returns

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:24.540
the

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:24.660
same

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.040
thing.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.360
So

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.540
this

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:25.740
is

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:25.880
how

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.060
you

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.500
turn

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.180
a

flask

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.600
app

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.220
into

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.200
something

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.660
production

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:29.920
ready.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.240
And

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.460
this

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:30.600
is

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:30.720
what

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.820
we

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.040
will

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.160
next

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:31.680
use

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.440
for

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.140
deploying

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.440
our

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.780

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.340
I

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:34.560
know

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.740
that

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.000
many

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.140
of

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.360
you

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.580
are

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:35.820
using

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.080
Windows.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.620
I

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:36.960
actually

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.340
also

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.560
use

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.920
Windows,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.180
as

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:38.380
you

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.580
can

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:38.880
see.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.240
This

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.660
is

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:39.660
a

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:39.940
Linux

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.440
subsystem.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:40.660
If

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.200
you're

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.600
using

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.080
plain

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.680
Windows,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:43.220
gunicorn

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.700
will

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:43.920
not

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.240
work.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:44.580
So

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.060
gunicorn

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.620
uses

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.220
some

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.060
Linux

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.300
or

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.200
Unix

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.700
specific

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.180
features.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:49.660
So

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:49.900
it

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.340
works

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:50.660
on

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:50.800
macOS.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.060
It

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.440
works

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:51.960
on

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.200
Linux.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:52.680
But

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:52.780
it

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.040
doesn't

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.220
work

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:53.420
on

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:53.720
Windows.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.040
So

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.140
if

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.500
you

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:54.900
try

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.120
to

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.420
run,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.460
just

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:56.840
try

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.980
to

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.300
install

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.460
it

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.600
as

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:57.860
well.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.420
pip

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.100
install.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:11:59.760
I

00:11:59.760 --> 00:11:59.940
don't

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.180
know

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.280
if

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.320
I

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:00.840
have

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:00.920
flask

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.020
on

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.520
Windows.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.900
Flask

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.760
gunicorn.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.440
So

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:05.600
now

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:05.700
I

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.180
have

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.180
flask.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:06.340
I

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.520
have

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:06.800
gunicorn.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.500
So

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:07.660
let

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:07.820
me

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.100
go

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.580
to

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:09.920
this

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.080
zoom

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:10.440
.com

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:10.720
directory.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.540
So

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:11.760
this

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:11.920
is

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.120
the

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.300
same

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:12.740
directory

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.280
we

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.580
used

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.560
in

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.000
this

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.200
tab.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.900
It's

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.000
the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.200
same

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.500
one.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.160
So

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.720
now

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.040
if

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.480
I,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:20.580
let

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.680
me

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.880
just

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:20.880
go

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.260
copy

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.660
this.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:24.280
If

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.400
I

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.660
run

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:24.840
that,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.320
it

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.480
will

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.860
say

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.240
no

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.620
module

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.160
name

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.920
fcntl.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.020
I

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.240
have

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.400
no

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.620
idea

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:29.760
what

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:29.920
is

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.080
that.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.540
If

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:30.980
you

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.440
try

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:31.680
to

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:31.780
Google

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.060
this,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.260
you

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:32.400
will

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:32.720
find

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:32.980
out

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.220
that

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.420
the

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:33.700
reason

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:33.960
for

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.140
that

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:34.420
is

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.820
because

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.360
gunicorn

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.720
does

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:35.900
not

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.260
support

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.600
Windows.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.220
So

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:37.220
if

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:37.580
you're

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:37.860
on

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.120
Windows

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.260
and

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:38.720
you

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.080
don't

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.380
want

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:39.600
to

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.240
install

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.820
the

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.240
subsystem

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:41.600
for

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:41.920
Linux,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.260
which

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.440
I

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.900
recommend

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.280
doing,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:43.500
you

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:43.600
should

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.040
definitely

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.260
do

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:44.480
this

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:44.580
if

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.140
you're

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.140
on

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.660
Windows.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:45.800
But

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.080
if

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.200
for

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.420
some

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.680
reasons

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:46.820
you

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:46.960
do

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.060
not

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:47.320
want

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.420
to

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.540
do

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:47.720
this,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:47.880
you

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.100
can

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.360
use

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.520
an

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.160
alternative.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.540
It's

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:49.760
called

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.280
waitress.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.220
install

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:52.840
waitress.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.740
It's

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:53.940
very

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.240
similar

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.540
to

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.040
gunicorn.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.620
Let's

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.000
install

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.160
it.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:56.600
And

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.080
then

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.460
you

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:57.900
use

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.000
it

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.240
very

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.800
similarly

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:58.980
to

00:12:59.300 --> 00:12:59.940
gunicorn.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.420
Let

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.640
me

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.000
just

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.420
get

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:01.900
gunicorn.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:02.500
Place

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:02.600
it

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.100
with

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.400
waitress.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:03.920
And

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.180
instead

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:04.740
of

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:04.740
bind,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.060
I

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.160
think

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.420
we

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.600
need

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:05.800
to

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:05.960
use

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.060
something

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.600
else.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:06.760
Let

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:06.960
me

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.240
quickly

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.460
Google

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.380
it.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.320
Instead

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.860
of

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:12.860
writing

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.340
gunicorn,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:13.680
we

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:13.840
write

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.480
waitress

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.760
serve.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.040
And

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.180
then

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.380
we

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:15.520
write

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:15.880
listen

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.140
instead

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.520
of

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:16.660
bind.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.680
So

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.400
waitress.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:21.600
Show

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.500
listen

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:23.560
0009696.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.420
And

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:26.640
then

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:26.980
again,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.360
predict

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:27.820
up.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.020
Yeah,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.200
so

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.380
I

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.520
have

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:32.960
these

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.400
weird

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.080
warnings.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.500
So

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.880
the

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.140
Windows

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:35.260
I

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:35.540
have

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:35.920
here

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.140
is

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.240
a

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.340
bit

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.820
special

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.120
because

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.420
it's

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:37.520
actually

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.000
a

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.180
tablet.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:38.560
It's

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:38.720
not

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:38.840
a

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.320
real

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:39.680
Windows

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.100
computer.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.260
I

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.440
think

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.820
that's

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.040
why

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.200
I

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.380
have

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:41.680
these

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:41.960
weird

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.400
warnings.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.040
I'm

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.180
not

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:43.900
really

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.180
sure

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.380
why

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:44.480
I

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:44.600
have

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:44.980
this.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:45.480
That's

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.660
why

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.000
please

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.860
ignore

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.140
them.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.460
But

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:47.680
there

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:47.840
is

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.440
not

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.240
actually

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.320
But

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:13.800
for

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.220
my

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.060
So

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.220
it's

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.380

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:21.760
So

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:21.760
it

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.120

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:26.480
That's

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:26.920
why

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.320
use

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.640
your

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.320

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:30.920

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.220
might

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.320
have

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.680

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.000

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.020
It's

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.160
not

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:33.740
actually

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.020
safe.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.500
That's

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:34.620
why

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:34.800
there

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:34.920
is

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:35.900
Okay,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.620
so

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.080
I

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.500
cannot

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:37.980

now

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.780

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:40.780

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.180

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.360
So

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:46.480
what

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.620
I'm

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:47.900
I

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.600
will

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:48.960
save

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.380

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.000
It's

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:51.560
a

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:52.800
And

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:54.820
I

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.180
will

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.280
put

this

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:56.660
into

our

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:57.660

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.180
Rename

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.400
it

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.040
as

predict

00:14:59.480 --> 00:14:59.820
test.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.040
It's

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.640
probably

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:00.980
a

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.320
name.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.020
I

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.120
will

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:02.360
just

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.740
remove

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.440

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.840
the

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.100

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.580
And

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:04.840
let

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.060
me

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.340
open

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.440
it

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.340
Code.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.920
So

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.300
I'll

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:08.480
do

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.580
a

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.700
bit

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.520
Here

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.860
we

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:10.960
have

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.280
the

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:11.640

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.300
here.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.040
And

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.300
we

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:13.580
have

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:13.860
the

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.220

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:15.740
So

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:15.900
what

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.020
I

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:16.160
want

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.280
to

do

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:16.740
is

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:16.860
I

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.000
just

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.260
want

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:17.420
to

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.820
print

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:18.560

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.000
So

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.340
print

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:24.980
And

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.740
customer

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.160

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:26.600
Let's

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:26.700
just

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.060
write

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.200
it

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:27.560
here.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:28.320
Customer

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.180
ID

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.280
is

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:29.820
XYZ123.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.920
Put

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.060
it

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.500
here.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:36.740
Okay,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.020
so

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.160
we

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.280
have

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.540
this

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.700
code

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.000
now.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.220
And

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.440
cleaned

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:40.600
it

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:40.720
a

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.040
little

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.320
bit.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.860
So

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.020
now

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.380
let's

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:42.580
run

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.000
this.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.520
So

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:43.600
we

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:43.720
have

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.140
another

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.740
command

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.080
prompt.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:45.780
So

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.880
I'm

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:45.980
in

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.180
the

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.280
same

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.780
directory.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.440
So

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.700
I

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:47.900
need

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:48.240
to

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.560
run

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.000
predict

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:49.940
test.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:51.460
So

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:51.920
now

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.400
it

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.680
was

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.900
able

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.120
to

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.640
communicate

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.500
with

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:54.600
Waitress

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:54.780
with

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:55.420
this

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:55.940
process

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.440
and

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:56.700
get

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:56.940
back

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:57.520
the

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:57.520
predictions.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.000
Okay,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.080
I

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.300
think

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:58.780
that's

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.200
it

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.340
for

00:15:59.540 --> 00:15:59.920
this

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.240
lesson.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:00.800
This

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.300
lesson

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.700
we

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.220
turned

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:02.660
our

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.020
predict

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.520
.py

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.660
script

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.220
into

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.560
a

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:04.600
Flask

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.220
application.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.600
And

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:05.700
then

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:05.880
we

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.100
saw

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.200
how

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:06.560
to

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.740
query

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.840
it

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.140
with

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.590
requests.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.200
Then

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.920
we

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.100
put

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.660
it

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:09.880
in

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.220
a

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.820
production

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.240
ready

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.840
VSGI

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.240
server,

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.460
which

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:12.780
is

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.160
GUnicorn.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.580
And

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.720
then

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:13.900
we

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.040
saw

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.220
how

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.500
to

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.740
also

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.940
do

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.120
this

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.300
on

using

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.220
Waitress.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:16.700
So

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:16.980
now

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.160
we

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.260
have

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.160
our

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:18.800
service

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.060
ready.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:19.500
And

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.020
in

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.180
the

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.480
next

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.160
lesson,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.320
we

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.460
will

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:21.700
talk

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.060
about

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:22.840
dependency

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.140
in

environment

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:23.880
management.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:24.540
If

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.800

version

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.000
and

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.340
another

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:27.700
project

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.060
uses

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.700
version,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:29.920
they

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.100
need

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.320
to

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.460
live
