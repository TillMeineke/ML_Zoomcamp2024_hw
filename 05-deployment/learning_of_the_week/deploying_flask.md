# 🚀 From Jupyter to Production: Deploying ML Models with Flask

🎯 Just wrapped up an incredible session on turning ML models into production-ready web services! Here's what got me excited:

## ⚡️ Key Highlights

* 🌐 Created a Flask-powered churn prediction API
* 🔄 Transformed Python scripts into robust web services
* 🎨 Built JSON endpoints for seamless data exchange
* 🛠️ Deployed with production-grade servers (Gunicorn/Waitress)

## 💡 Pro Tips I Learned

* 🔥 Use POST methods for sending customer data
* 🛡️ Always JSONify your responses correctly
* 🚦 Handle NumPy data types before JSON serialization
* 🖥️ Windows users: Waitress is your friend when Gunicorn isn't available!

> 💎 **Golden Nugget**: Keep your core prediction logic separate from the web service boilerplate - your future self will thank you!

## 🌟 Tech Stack Used

* Flask for API creation
* Gunicorn/Waitress for production deployment
* Python requests for API testing
* JSON for data exchange
