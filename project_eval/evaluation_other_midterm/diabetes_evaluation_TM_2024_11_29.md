# Evaluation of midterm project

Evaluation done by Till Meineke on Nov. 29th 2024.

## Problem description

* 2 points: Problem is described in README with enough context, so it's clear what the problem is and how the solution will be used

## EDA

* 2 points: Extensive EDA (ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis)

## Model training

* 3 points: Trained multiple models and tuned their parameters.

## Exporting notebook to script

* 1 point: The logic for training the model is exported to a separate script

## Reproducibility

* 1 point: It's possible to re-execute the notebook and the training script without errors. The dataset is committed in the project repository or there are clear instructions on how to download the data

* `python codes/predict_main.py`, had to change into `codes` folder to run the script, otherwise it would not find the `dv.bin` file. Not mentioned in `README.md` file.

[15:04:23] WARNING: /Users/runner/work/xgboost/xgboost/python-package/build/temp.macosx-11.0-arm64-cpython-38/xgboost/src/learner.cc:553: 
  If you are loading a serialized model (like pickle in Python, RDS in R) generated by
  older XGBoost, please export the model by calling `Booster.save_model` from that version
  first, then load it back in current version. See:

    https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html

  for more details about differences between saving model and serializing.
