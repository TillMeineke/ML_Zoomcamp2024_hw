### ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

I evaluated the submission according to the following criteria:

1. Problem description
   - [x] Problem is described in README with enough context, so it's clear what the problem is and how the solution will be used (2 points)
2. EDA
   - [x] Extensive EDA (ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis). For images: analyzing the content of the images. For texts: frequent words, word clouds, etc. (2 points)
3. Model training
   - [x] Trained multiple models and tuned their parameters. For neural networks: same as previous, but also with tuning: adjusting learning rate, dropout rate, size of the inner layer, etc. (3 points)
4. Exporting notebook to script
   - [x] The logic for training the model is exported to a separate script (1 point)
5. Reproducibility
   - [x] It's possible to re-execute the notebook and the training script without errors. The dataset is committed in the project repository or there are clear instructions on how to download the data (1 point)
6. Model deployment
   - [x] Model is deployed (with Flask, BentoML or a similar framework) (1 point)
7. Dependency and environment management
   - [] Provided a file with dependencies (requirements.txt, pipfile, bentofile.yaml with dependencies, etc.) (1 point)
   - [x] Provided a file with dependencies and used virtual environment. README says how to install the dependencies and how to activate the env (2 points)
8. Containerization
   - [x] The application is containerized and the README describes how to build a container and how to run it (2 points)
9. Cloud deployment
   - [x] There's code for deployment to cloud or Kubernetes cluster (local or remote). There's a URL for testing - or video/screenshot of testing it (2 points)

Comment:  
Very nice project. I like the extensive EDA and the model tuning. The deployment is also well done.
